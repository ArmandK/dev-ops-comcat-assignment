I am using my own AWS services to do this assignment
<P>
I used Chef as the automation configuration tool to create an Apache web server

No source code, but all the steps are well explained using the screenshots provided.

Since, I am paying for the AWS EC2 instances..I stopped the instances by the time you tried to see the URL..but not terminated them
