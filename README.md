# devOps-comcast-Assignment

I am using my own AWS services to do this assignment
I used Chef as the automation configuration tool to create an Apache web server
No source code, but all the steps are well explained using the screenshots provided.
Since, I am paying for the AWS EC2 instances..I stopped the instances by the time you tried to see the URL..but not terminated them
